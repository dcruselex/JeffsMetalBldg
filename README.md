# JeffsMetalBldg

The purpose of this project was to create a mobile first website with specific features to demonstrate what I have learned in this course.

The website is going to be used to provide potential suppliers information to quote on different parts of the project to build a metal building on a lot at Lake Cumberland and meet local required codes along with features that a friend wants included.   They will email their quotes to a specific email address.  The areas for potential suppliers to review will inlcudes Site Prep for Concrete Pad, Plumbing, Electrical, Metal Frame Erection and Installation, Metal roof, side install, insulation, doors, windows, etc..

This unit is a being erected on a lot purchased at Lake Cumberland for boat and storage to include a small roughed in area for kitchen, bathroom, additional utility sink, and warm sitting area when we are working on the recreational vehicles.

CSS Features among others:
1) Smaller screen size-  "Hamburger" menu vertical,  Larger screen sizes- Horizontal menu
Meets requirement:  A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the "hamburger" menu item.
2) Bootstrap:
Imported Bootsrap, then used Bootstrap's features to organize content areas based on mobile or dektop views.

JavaScript Features amoung others:
