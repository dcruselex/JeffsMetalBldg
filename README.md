The purpose of this project was to create a mobile first website with specific features.

The website is going to be used to provide potential suppliers information to quote on different parts of the project to build a metal building on a lot at Lake Cumberland and meet local required codes along with features that a friend wants included.   They will email their quotes to a specific email address.  The areas for potential suppliers to review will inlcude:
1) Site Prep for Concrete
2) Concrete Pad Pour and Install
3) Plumbing (include layout and installed components prior to pad pour, then the plumbing components after the building is framed and until final inspection.)
4) Electrical (include layout and installed components prior to pad pour, then the electrical components after the building is framed and until final inspection)
5) Metal Frame Erection and Installation including required prep components before pad pour.
6) Metal roof and side install, insulation, doors, windows, etc..
