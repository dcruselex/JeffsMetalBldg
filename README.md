The purpose of this project was to create a mobile first website with specific features to demonstrate what I have learned in this course.

The website is going to be used to provide potential suppliers information to quote on different parts of the project to build a metal building on a lot at Lake Cumberland and meet local required codes along with features that a friend wants included.   They will email their quotes to a specific email address.  The areas for potential suppliers to review will inlcude:
1) Site Prep for Concrete
2) Concrete Pad Pour and Install
3) Plumbing (include layout and installed components prior to pad pour, then the plumbing components after the building is framed and until final inspection.)
4) Electrical (include layout and installed components prior to pad pour, then the electrical components after the building is framed and until final inspection)
5) Metal Frame Erection and Installation including required prep components before pad pour.
6) Metal roof and side install, insulation, doors, windows, etc..

This unit is a being erected on a lot purchased at Lake Cumberland for boat and storage to include a small roughed in area for kitchen, bathroom, additional utility sink, and warm sitting area when we are working on the recreational vehicles.

For this project I have utilized: 
1) Actual pictures of the project, drawings and some stock photos.
2) Media queries that scale up to handle larger devices
3) Media queries that change menus that realign/move content areas, changing the menu, etc.
